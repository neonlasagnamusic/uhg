A chrome extension with links to various virtual party games my team likes

# Install
Until I get it up into the Chrome App Store, the only way to see it is to:

- clone the repo files into a folder
- Open Chrome & go to chrome://extensions/
- Turn on Developer Mode (top right).
- Click Load unpacked.
- Select the folder location you saved the files to.
- and Viola!
